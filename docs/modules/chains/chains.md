# Chains

> [Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains)

Using an LLM in isolation is fine for some simple applications, but more complex applications 
require chaining LLMs - either with each other or with other experts. LangChain provides a standard 
interface for Chains, as well as several common implementations of chains.

- How-To Guides: How-to guides about various types of chains.
- [Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/langchain): API reference documentation for all LLM
  classes.
