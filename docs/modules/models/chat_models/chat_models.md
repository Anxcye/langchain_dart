# Chat Models

> [Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/models/chat-model)

Chat models are a variation on language models. While chat models use language models under the 
hood, the interface they expose is a bit different. Rather than expose a “text in, text out” API, 
they expose an interface where “chat messages” are the inputs and outputs.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- [Getting Started](/modules/models/chat_models/getting_started): An overview of all the 
  functionality the LangChain Chat model class provides.
- How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various
  objectives with our Chat model class.
- Integrations: A collection of examples on how to integrate different Chat model providers with 
  LangChain (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc).
- [Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/langchain): API reference documentation for all Chat 
  model classes.
