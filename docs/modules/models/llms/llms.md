# LLMs

> [Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/models/language-model)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain. LangChain is not a provider of
LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface through which you can interact with a variety of
LLMs.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- [Getting Started](/modules/models/llms/getting_started): An overview of all the functionality the
  LangChain LLM class provides.
- How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various
  objectives with our LLM class (streaming, async, etc).
- Integrations: A collection of examples on how to integrate different LLM providers with LangChain
  (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc).
- [Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/langchain): API reference documentation for all LLM
  classes.
