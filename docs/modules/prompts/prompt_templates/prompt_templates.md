# Prompt Templates

> [Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/prompts/prompt-template)

Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt. Typically this 
is not simply a hardcoded string but rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user 
input. LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with 
prompts easy.

The following sections of documentation are provided:
- [Getting Started](/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/getting_started): An overview of all the 
  functionality LangChain provides for working with and constructing prompts.
- How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various 
  objectives with our prompt class.
- [Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/langchain): API reference documentation for all prompt
  classes.
