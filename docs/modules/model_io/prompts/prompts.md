# Prompts

The new way of programming models is through prompts. A **prompt** refers to 
the input to the model. This input is often constructed from multiple 
components.

LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and 
working with prompts easy.

- [Prompt templates](/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/prompt_templates.md): 
  Parametrize model inputs.
- [Example selectors](/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/example_selectors.md): 
  Dynamically select examples to include in prompts.
