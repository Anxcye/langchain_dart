# Setup and Installation

To get started, add LangChain.dart dependency to your project `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  langchain: {version}
```

Then, run `pub get` to install the package.

Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores,
tools APIs, etc.

For example, if you wan to use OpenAIâ€™s APIs, you will need to add LangChain.dart OpenAI package
as well:

```yaml
dependencies:
  langchain: {version}
  langchain_openai: {version}
```
