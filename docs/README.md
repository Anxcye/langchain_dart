# Welcome to LangChain.dart

**LangChain.dart** is a Dart port of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe 
that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, 
but will also be:
1. *Data-aware*: connect a language model to other sources of data.
2. *Agentic*: allow a language model to interact with its environment.

The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.

This is the Dart specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, 
see [here](https://docs.langchain.com/docs).
